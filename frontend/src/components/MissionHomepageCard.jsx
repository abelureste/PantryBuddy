                    <p>Consumer food waste is a significant and growing problem that affects not only individual households but also the global environment and economy. In developed countries, much of the food waste occurs at the consumer level — in kitchens, restaurants, and grocery stores — where edible food is discarded due to over-purchasing, misinterpretation of expiration dates, or aesthetic preferences. This waste contributes to resource inefficiency, as the water, energy, labor, and land used to produce that food are also squandered.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Beyond the environmental toll, food waste exacerbates social issues such as food insecurity. While millions of people lack access to sufficient nutrition, vast amounts of perfectly edible food are thrown away. According to the United Nations, nearly one-third of all food produced globally is wasted, accounting for nearly 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Reducing consumer food waste requires a shift in behavior and mindset. Simple practices like meal planning, proper food storage, understanding food labeling, and creative use of leftovers can significantly cut down on waste. Technology and awareness campaigns also play a crucial role, empowering individuals to make smarter consumption choices and contribute to a more sustainable food system.</p>
